# Hi, I'm Daniel Mon Chit 👋

I'm a software developer and tech enthusiast with a passion for building practical tools that make people's lives easier. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading a good book, hitting the gym, or exploring the outdoors.
I also enjoy learning Irish, which you will find sprinkled all over my apps and websites.
