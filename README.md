# Hi, I'm Daniel Mon Chit, a software developer and tech enthusiast with a passion for building practical tools that make people's lives easier. 👋

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading a good book, hitting the gym, or exploring the outdoors.

I also enjoy learning Irish, which you will find sprinkled all over my apps and websites.

**🧠 Developer with a Ruby Heart**
I'm a software developer with a deep affinity for the Ruby programming language. Ruby is elegant, expressive, and endlessly practical.

**🌱 Grounded in Curiosity**
An aspiring Buddhist and occasional tree hugger (when the mood strikes), I balance idealism with pragmatism. I believe in thoughtful action, not just thoughtful intention.

**📚 Slow Moments, Deep Focus**

Whether it's reading by the fire, tending to the garden, or experimenting in the kitchen, I find clarity in quiet routines. These moments recharge my creativity and sharpen my focus.

**🚀 Driven by creativity and exploration**

I thrive on the joy that comes from Aha! moments, deep exploration, and the power of a clear vision. I believe in strong opinions, while i hold them loosely enough to evolve.
